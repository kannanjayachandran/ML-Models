# Two layer Neural Network

- This is a simple two layer neural network implemented in python to recognize handwritten digits.

- The neural network is trained using the MNIST dataset available at kaggle.

- The neural network is implemented from scratch using numpy.

- By default the neural network is trained for 500 epochs and the accuracy is ~84%.

## This neural network has the following architecture

- Input layer: 784 neurons (28x28 pixels) arranged in the for of a matrix.

## This neural network uses

- Forward propagation

- Backpropagation

- Gradient descent

## This neural network uses the following activation functions

- ReLU

- Softmax

## Dependencies

- numpy
- pandas
